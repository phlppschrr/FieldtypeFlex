# Changelog

## 0.3.0 (pre-release)

- Aligned Page reference loading, formatting, assignment and selection validation with native FieldtypePage; editor submissions replace selections, including in rows.
- Aligned unformatted Datetime reads with native Unix timestamps, formatted multilingual reads with strings, Float precision and default Checkbox/Toggle values. Added native Email/URL normalization; canonical JSON formats remain unchanged.
- Added direct native-field comparison tests and documented the explicit boundaries of Fieldtype compatibility.

- Added the explicit `rows` structure type with `addRowLabel`, `rowCollapse` and per-type `rowTitle`; native wrapper definitions use `InputfieldFlexRows`.

- Simplified editor error handling and shared technical messages; invalid repeatable presentation settings now use safe defaults. Updated bundled translations to remove obsolete phrases.

- Bundled German, French and Spanish admin translations, including editor messages and the example catalog. Install or update them through Module Information → Languages → install translations.
- Added typed rows collections with stable row IDs and per-type schemas.
- Added recursive nested rows collections, parent-aware selectors and subtree duplication.
- Added Flex-managed File and Image properties with staged edits, native-compatible media objects and cleanup.
- Added use inside native ProcessWire Repeater items.
- Added typed row selectors, collection counts and same-row expressions.
- Added definition source diagnostics, property-label helpers and configurable resource budgets.
- Established the versioned rows:1 envelope for typed repeatable data.
